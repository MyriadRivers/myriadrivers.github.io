                    Sync or Sink is a synchronized swimming rhythm game, developed in Unity with C#. I coded some of the dialogue
                    system, illustrated a few assets, and composed the large majority of the music.

                    Sync or Sink was the second game that I made with friends after a dungeon puzzler called "Slime Travel". It was initially
                    made for a Technology Student Association competition in high school, in which the theme that
                    year was "sports" games. We decided to make a game based off of synchronized swimming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We were able to get third place in the Nationals conference, and later on in college we added some more features
                    like a story mode and were selected to demo at various exhibits such as DreamHack Atlanta's Student Game Showcase and SIEGE Con.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The full game actually includes a custom editor to make your own levels as well as 7 more levels of much harder difficulty,
                    however this version was never released publicly.
