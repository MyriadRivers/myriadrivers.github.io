                    Sync or Sink is a rhythm game with visual novel elements, following five friends who make up their school's artistic swimming team.
                    In each level, the team performs a routine in front of a panel judges, as they try to make their way to the top of the conference.

                    Sync or Sink was the second game that I made with friends after an initial dungeon puzzler called "Slime Travel". It was initially
                    made for a Technology Student Association competition in high school, in which the theme that
                    year was "sports" games. We decided to make a game based off of synchronized swimming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The full game includes a custom editor to make custom levels as well as 7 more levels of much harder difficulty;
                    however, this version was never publicly released.

                    Sync or Sink ranked 1st in the Georgia TSA state conference and 3rd in the national conference. During college, additional features
                    were added including a story mode. The game was also selected to demo at various exhibits such as DreamHack Atlanta's Student Game Showcase and SIEGE Con.
