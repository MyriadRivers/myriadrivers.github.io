                    Fenceline communities, also known as sacrifice zones, are communities located extremely close to heavily polluting industrial facilities,
                    where residents face high rates of health risks, disease, and birth defects. These companies hold significant economic and legal sway,
                    meaning communities must rely on grassroots organization for any hope of change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pursued a 16-week end-to-end UX project involving the research and design of a new system to integrate with Facebook, a tool many of these
                    communities already rely on. These features aim to help community leaders more effectively mobilize and monitor their residents.

                    Our research made it evident that fenceline community members must form a broad coalition of diverse stakeholders including

                    Addressing all of these concerns and connections would be impossible for a single project; thus we initially decided to narrow our
                    focus to specifically <b>the relationship between communities and researchers</b>, as we felt this was an area that could best benefit from

                    Based on the difficulties of data collection and conflicts of interest with scientists,
                    we decided to focus on the project management idea and to scope down even further to center around intra-community
                    communication, specifically <b>between community organizers and regular residents</b>, leading to our current problem statement.

                <p>
                    With our focus narrowed down to organization and hierarchy within an already existent fenceline community,
                    we eliminated <b>FR 1: Communicate Danger</b> to focus on getting people involved through action items rather than raising initial awareness.
                    We also reoriented <b>FR 3: Facilitate Understanding</b> towards community leaders instead of researchers, leading to our updated functional design requirements:
                </p>
                <ol className="fr">
                    <li>
                        <span><b>Suggest Actions: </b>Design should suggest concrete and actionable items to community members.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span><b>Facilitate Understanding: </b>Design should enable community organizers to develop an intimate and empathetic understanding of constituent residents.</span>
                    </li>

                        <span><b>Encourage Discussion: </b>Design should facilitate creating a safe and open online environment to gather feedback from all community members.</span>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Our non-functional design requirements remained unchanged.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these new design requirements, our final idea was to integrate with an existing system many communities
                    already use for a similar purposeâ€”Facebook groups.

                    Our prototype was developed in Figma, representing a new page/tab on a Facebook group called the "Dashboard".

                <p>
                    Organizers have the ability to create <b>Timelines</b>, which represent a chronological sequence of Facebook posts
                    related to a specific topic, for instance EPA Regulations. This allows residents to easily track the progress of specific processes
                    (<b>NFR 2: Transparent Processes</b>) without having to scroll down the usual Facebook feed (<b>NFR 1: Organization and Hierarchy</b>).
                    Clicking on a node in the timeline reveals a popup of the original post along with comments, allowing for residents to discuss
                    the event and see what others are thinking (<b>FR 3: Encourage Discussion</b>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each Timeline event can have specific <b>Action Items</b> related to it that residents should complete, for instance if the node represents
                    data collection then action items might be going to a workshop or sending in samples (<b>FR 1: Suggest Actions</b>).

                <p>
                    For each Action Item, community organizers can set a deadline and a minimum target number of residents they want to complete it.
                    Organizers can then track the progress of these items, seeing how many residents have completed the task so far.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organizers can also view insights for each Action Item, which brings out a more detailed view of who has completed the item and reported
                    reasons why those who have yet to complete the item have not done so, which is taken from a popup that residents see on their end.
                    This allows organizers to understand exactly why residents are having trouble completing tasks (<b>FR 2: Facilitate Understanding</b>),
                    while also being able to respond to residents individually in a private space; residents may also leave these comments anonymously,
                    allowing them to feel safer and more open to discussion (<b>FR 3: Encourage Discussion</b>). Community organizers may also send
                    group messages to all residents who reported a specific blocker.

                <p>
                    The most critical Action Items for each Timeline can be pinned to the <b>Urgent Action Items</b> bar at the top of the page for maximum visibility.
                    This lets users see what tasks are the most important to get done, either due to their impact or impending deadline <b>(FR 1: Suggest Actions)</b>.
                    Urgent Action items are tagged and color-coded to make it easier to associate with the corresponding Timeline.

                <Heading level={4}>Marking a Task Complete</Heading>
                <p>
                    After an Action Item is completed, community organizers can mark it complete, sending out
                    a congratulatory post in the feed. Organizers can also choose to have tasks that surpass their target threshold automatically marked for completion.
                    Finally, organizers also have the option to add follow-up posts referencing the results of the completed task in either the Timeline or in the feed,
                    making it clear what effect users have on the process (<b>NFR 2: Transparent Processes</b>).

                <p>
                    Throughout our design in the Action Items, Timeline events, and Posts, community organizers can add descriptions explaining the effects of events
                    and resident actions, allowing users to understand what has already been done, what they are currently doing, and how it affects them
                    (<b>NFR 3: Non-expert Accessibility</b>).

                    Participants were given the clickable prototype and a worksheet with each of these heuristics broken down into criteria evaluating
                    very specific parts of the system, for instance button feedback or typography.
                    Each of these criteria was rated on a scale from 0, a complete usability failure with no positive experiences, to 5,
                    an elegant and intuitive design that wastes zero time and creates no confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each participant was paired with one researcher from our team. The researcher explained the system briefly, and then asked the participant to
                    walk through 3 tasks broadly corresponding to the functions of the prototype (viewing a timeline, responding to a blocked resident,
                    and marking a task complete), <b>thinking aloud</b> as they used the system. Researches took note of any voiced or observed confusions
                    when using the system.

                <p>

                    to add more detailed notes about specific areas of confusion or features for each heuristic.
                </p>

                    Finally, participants openly discussed their experience with researchers, highlighting what they liked and what they found confusing,
