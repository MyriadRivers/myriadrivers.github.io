                    This project looks at communities facing environmental injustice, specifically fenceline communities (a.k.a. "Sacrifice Zones") that are situated
                    in extreme proximity to heavily polluting industrial plants.

                    We focused specifically on the connection between communities and environmental scientists:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>How can we best foster relationships between residents facing environmental injustice and researchers to improve community well-being?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    User research included literature review; social media mining from online communities supporting fenceline neighborhoods;
                    semi-structured interviews with environmental researchers, community organizers, and residents; hierarchical task analysis of existing strategies;
                    and finally field research through participant observation of local community meetings on environmental concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We used thematic analysis through affinity mapping to draw broad, underlying conclusions based on the qualitative data, which we then
                    used to iteratively and rapidly generate many design sketches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Design ideas were refined collaboratively and the two best were storyboarded to outline contexts of use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the team used the best design to generate a high fidelity prototype to evaluate with users.
