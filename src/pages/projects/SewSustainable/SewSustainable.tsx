                    The fashion industry is a major contributor to global climate change, as measured in tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2eq) [1].
                    Besides ecological effects such as massive water consumption and production of harmful microplastics, the industry also employs
                    hundreds of millions of people worldwide [2], many of whom work in sweatshop conditions.

                    Sustainable fashion, as measured by certifications such as the EU Ecolabel and OEKO-TEX Made in Green label [3], should broadly be:
